## Project Overview
Airbed & Coffee is a full-stack clone of the Airbnb website, replicating its features and functionality - an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with those looking for accommodations. After signing up, Airbed & Coffee users can browse through a listing page with preloaded listings and book a reservation for their desired stay directly through the platform.

Technologies implemented in this project:

- Ruby: Version 3.1.1
- Rails: Version 7.1.3.3
- PostgreSQL: Used for the database
- React and Redux: Employed for frontend development
- TailwindCSS: Applied for styling
- AWS S3: Utilized for image storage
